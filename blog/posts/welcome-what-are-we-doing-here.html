                <p>Welcome to my new blog, <strong>"What are we doing here?"</strong> - a question I find myself asking daily as I navigate the rapidly evolving landscape of technology, finance, and personal wellness.</p>

                <p>This blog is born from a simple observation: we're living through an unprecedented convergence of accessible AI tools, cloud technologies, and data analytics platforms that were once reserved for enterprise use. The question isn't whether we should be using these tools for personal projects - it's <em>how</em> we can leverage them meaningfully.</p>

                <h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>

                <p><strong>Tech & AI Focus:</strong> I'll be documenting my journey with tools like Claude Code, Databricks, and modern cloud platforms. Expect deep dives into how AI-assisted development is changing the way we build and think about software.</p>

                <p><strong>Finance Through Data:</strong> Personal finance meets data science. I'll explore how to use enterprise-grade analytics tools for personal financial insights, budgeting with SQL, and building dashboards that actually help make better money decisions.</p>

                <p><strong>Fitness Tracking Revolution:</strong> Moving beyond simple step counters to building comprehensive health analytics using cloud databases, automated tracking, and data visualization tools that provide actionable insights.</p>

                <h2>The Databricks Connection</h2>

                <p>Why Databricks? Because it represents something fascinating - a platform designed for massive enterprise data that's becoming accessible for personal use. When you can spin up a lakehouse architecture to analyze your workout data alongside your financial transactions, you start to see patterns that simple apps miss.</p>

                <p>I'll be exploring practical applications like:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Connecting Neon PostgreSQL fitness data to Databricks for advanced analytics</li>
                    <li>Building personal dashboards that combine health, financial, and productivity metrics</li>
                    <li>Using AI-powered insights to make better life decisions</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Built with Claude Code</h2>

                <p>This entire blog and the underlying portfolio site were built using Claude Code - Anthropic's AI-powered development assistant. Every post will include insights into how AI-assisted development is changing not just what we build, but how we think about building.</p>

                <p>So, what are we doing here? We're experimenting, learning, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible when powerful tools meet personal curiosity. Join me as we explore this intersection of technology, data, and daily life.</p>

                <p><em>Next up: Setting up Neon PostgreSQL for fitness tracking and preparing the data pipeline for Databricks integration.</em></p>
